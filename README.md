An interesting challenge you encountered when implementing Howler. What was the issue and how did you solve it?
One challenge I had while implementing was the follow and unfollow success boxes not being displayed even though the action was successful. I solved this by sending a json return from the api call that wasn't used but would allow me to enter the .then loop so I could show the user that the updates were successful.


What additional feature would you add to Howler and how would you suggest it should be implemented?
I think one additional feature would be to add your own posts to the post list and/or store all json posts in chronilogical order. This would make the feed better or to view all posts in chronilogical order easier.
